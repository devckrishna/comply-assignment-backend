Insurance Producer: An individual licensed to sell or negotiate life insurance products.
Policy: Any life insurance or annuity contract that provides benefits under the regulation.
Subsections of Definitions may also define:

Institutional Advertising: General advertisements that focus on the company or brand rather than specific policies.

Section 5: Disclosure Requirements
This section mandates that advertisements must provide clear and full disclosure of important policy details, particularly those that could affect the consumer's decision-making process.

The omission of material information is prohibited if it results in the consumer being misled about the nature or cost of the policy.

Subsection 5.3: Policy Changes
If the policy allows the insurer to make changes (e.g., to premiums), these conditions must be disclosed.

Subsection 5.4: Limitations and Exclusions
Advertisements must clearly present any limitations or exclusions to coverage. For example, if a policy excludes certain illnesses, this must be explicitly stated.

The name of the insurer must be prominently displayed in all advertisements.

Subsection 6.2: Availability of Policies
The advertisement must clearly disclose if a policy or insurer is unavailable in certain states or jurisdictions.

Subsection 7.1: Licensing Status
Advertisements must clearly state where the insurer is licensed to operate.

Subsection 7.2: Government Endorsement
The ad must not imply that a policy is endorsed by a governmental entity unless this is true.

Subsection 8.1: Financial Stability
Advertisements must not make exaggerated claims about the insurer’s financial condition, solvency, or stability.

Subsection 8.2: Ratings Information

Subsection 11.1: Interpretation
If any conflict arises, this section outlines how the regulation should be interpreted in relation to other laws.

Section 12: Severability
